Region-based segmentation is a technique for determining the region directly. Region growing is a simple region-based image segmentation method. It is also classified as a pixel-based image segmentation method since it involves the selection of initial seed points. The region-based segmentation method looks for similarities between adjacent pixels. That is, pixels that possess similar attributes are grouped into unique regions.
